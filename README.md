# Hungry Snake

## Project Overview

Hungry Snake - The classic mobile game makes it's way to the Python Command Line Interface!! Control the snake to eat food and grow as big as you can to earn more points. The game is over if the snake runs into the edge of the screen or eats it's own tail!

## Project Goals and Target Audience

Hungry Snake is intended to be picked up and played by anyone! The aim of the game is to move the snake around the board and collect food. As the snake eats food, it becomes bigger and the user's score is increased. The game will end if the snake runs into the edge of the board or it it eats it's own tail. The game features multiple levels of difficulty to challenge players of all levels.
