# Hungry Snake

## Project Overview

Hungry Snake - The classic mobile game makes it's way to the Python Command Line Interface!! Control the snake to eat food and grow as big as you can to earn more points. The game is over if the snake runs into the edge of the screen or eats it's own tail!

## Project Goals and Target Audience

Hungry Snake is intended to be picked up and played by anyone! The aim of the game is to move the snake around the board and collect food. As the snake eats food, it becomes bigger and the user's score is increased. The game will end if the snake runs into the edge of the board or it it eats it's own tail. The game features multiple levels of difficulty to challenge players of all levels.

### User Stories

1. I want a game I can pick up and play that doesn't take too much time. Snake is perfect for when I have a few minutes to kill while I'm waiting to join a call and want to occupy myself that can be fun and challenging. 
2. I have played Snake before as a child on my old mobile phone and I am very used to how the game plays. Having the option of increasing the difficulty is very useful as I then have the option to make the game more difficult and engaging.

## Coding Languages Used

1. Python

## Wireframes

1. Please wireframe for the game on initialisation [here](assets/wireframes/start-of-game.png).

## Features

### Existing Features

1. Controlling the Snake. As soon as the game loads, the initial piece of food is created and users must use the directional buttons on their keyboard to steer the snake towards it.
2. Collision detection. As per the rules of the classic game, the game is over if the snake runs into the edge of the screen or into itself. The game has been coded to react to these instances when they occur and end the game when they do.

### Future Features

1. Mongoose mode. In a future update, I would like to create an extra difficulty that includes a mongoose (an animal known for preying on snakes) that also appears on the map and which players also must avoid while collecting food.
2. User save data. In a future update, I would like to include a feature that can retain the user's high score even after the game has been closed.
